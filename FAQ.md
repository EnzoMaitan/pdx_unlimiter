### Why should I use this?

If you are an experienced player of various Paradox games, you probably have encountered the following situations:

- Playing multiple campaigns interleaved and losing the overview over where exactly you left of
- Making many different checkpoint saves like `*_backup_backup.eu4` that you can revert
  back to in case anything goes wrong and ruins your campaign
- Wanting to easily edit a savegame to toy around or experiment because console commands are only limited in their power
- Using one or more third party tools like an Ironman converter or
  savegame converters to continue your savegame in another game 
- Organizing and cleaning your existing savegame collection quickly
- Waiting to load for the main menu to load because you can't use the
  `Continue Game` button in the launcher for Ironman savegames
  
For every item of the list above, the Pdx-Unlimiter comes with a corresponding solution.
You can find detailed information about that in the
[Pdx-Unlimiter Guide](https://github.com/crschnick/pdx_unlimiter/blob/master/GUIDE.md).

As a result, if you only play one campaign at a time and therefore do not switch between mod configurations,
do not make savegame backups to either savescum or protect against data loss,
do not use any commonly used third party tools for Paradox games,
and never edit your savegames to either experiment or do some multiplayer configuration changes,
then the Pdx-Unlimiter is not really useful to you!

### Is this a replacement for the Paradox Launcher?

No, since it does not provide a user interface for enabling/disabling/installing
mods or connecting your Paradox account. The primary focus lies on savegame management some other features.


### What games are supported?

- EU4: Full support
- CK3: Full support
- HOI4: Yes, but currently lacking a savegame information display like for EU4
- Stellaris: Yes, but no mod integration since Stellaris savegames do not store mod information

Note that only installations using the Paradox Launcher are supported.
I.e. old game versions do not work.


### Can I use this in combination with other launchers?

If you are using some third party mod manager like [Irony](https://bcssov.github.io/IronyModManager/),
you can still use the Pdx-Unlimiter as it does not interfere with managing mods.


### What operating systems are supported?

Windows and Linux.
