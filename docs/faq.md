### Is this a replacement for the Paradox Launcher / Steam?

No, since it does not provide a user interface for enabling/disabling/installing
mods or connecting your Paradox account. The primary focus lies on savegame management and editing.

### What games are supported?

- EU4: Full support
- HOI4: Currently not, since we use [Rakaly](https://github.com/rakaly)
  and it does not support hoi4 savegames (yet)
- Stellaris: Yes, but no mod integration since Stellaris savegames do not store mod information
- CK3: Yes, but currently lacking a savegame information display like for EU4

Note that only installations using the Paradox Launcher are supported.
I.e. old game versions do not work.

### Can I use this in combination with other launchers?

If you are using some third party mod manager like [Irony](https://bcssov.github.io/IronyModManager/),
you can still use the Pdx-Unlimiter as it does not interfere with managing mods.


### What operating systems are supported?

Windows and Linux.
